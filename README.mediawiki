'''Introduction'''

A simple but powerful game framework.
It is abstracted and can be used with any graphic/input/physic/etc API.
It does use some C++0x features, such as nullptr and unordered_map.

Please note that this framework is still under heavy development and might undergo major changes.

It is lacking in documentation, but there is a doxygen of the awesome branch available [http://protozed.zguyserver.nu/ here].
