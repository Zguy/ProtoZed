'''Introduction'''

A simple but powerful game framework.

Please note that this framework is still under heavy development and might undergo major changes.

It is lacking in documentation, but there is a doxygen of the awesome branch available [[http://protozed.zguyserver.nu/ here]].

'''Features:'''
* A state system.
* An entity system with messaging.
** Components
* An animation system, loosely based on AS tweens.
** Spritesheets
* A general asset manager.
* A log system.

'''Dependencies:'''
* [[http://www.sfml-dev.org/ SFML 1.6]]
* [[http://www.boost.org/ boost 1.48.0]]

''''Platform Support:'''
* Windows
* Linux*
* Mac OS X*
*These are not tested, but they should work. Every third party library I'm using has support for them and all of my own code should be platform independent.

(Note: Only Visual Studio 2010 project files are provided so far)
